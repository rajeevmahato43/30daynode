The idea of microtask and macrotask queues is a simplification to help understand the core concept of asynchronous programming. 
However, to accurately represent the event loop's mechanics, it's essential to understand the "phase-based" approach.


Phases: The event loop iterates through different phases, processing tasks in each phase.
No Explicit Queues: While there aren't strictly defined microtask and macrotask queues, the concept of task priority and execution order still applies.
Task Prioritization: The phases themselves determine the order in which tasks are executed. For example, timers in the Timers phase have a different priority than I/O operations in the Poll phase.

Each phase has its queue to store callbacks waiting to be executed.

Event Loop Phase:- 

   ┌───────────────────────────┐
┌─>│           timers          │
│  └─────────────┬─────────────┘
│  ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
│  │     pending callbacks     │
│  └─────────────┬─────────────┘
│  ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
│  │       idle, prepare       │
│  └─────────────┬─────────────┘      ┌───────────────┐
│  ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐      │   incoming:   │
│  │           poll            │<─────┤  connections, │
│  └─────────────┬─────────────┘      │   data, etc.  │
│  ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐      └───────────────┘
│  │           check           │
│  └─────────────┬─────────────┘
│  ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
└──┤      close callbacks      │
   └───────────────────────────┘

   There are actually seven or eight steps, but the ones we care about — ones that Node.js actually uses - are those above.

In Node.js, an event demultiplexer is a crucial component of its event-driven architecture. It plays a key role in managing multiple I/O operations efficiently. Here’s a breakdown of how it works:

Event Loop: Node.js uses an event loop to handle asynchronous operations. The event loop continuously checks for events and processes them in a non-blocking manner.
Event Demultiplexer: This component listens for events from various sources (like file systems, network requests, timers, etc.) and queues them for the event loop to process. It essentially acts as a dispatcher, routing events to the appropriate handlers.
Reactor Pattern: Node.js employs the reactor pattern, where the event demultiplexer waits for events and then dispatches them to the corresponding callback functions12.
