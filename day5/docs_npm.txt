What is package.json
    package.json is a way to manage the locally installed packages.
    package.json serves as documentation on which our project depends.
    It is kind of a directory which keeps track of all the dependencies our project is using.
    It allows us to specify the versions of packages our project is using. This is achieved using semantic versioning rules

Create package.json
    npm init / npm init -y
